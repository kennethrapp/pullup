# How to contribute

The only way to join the pullup community is via pull request. Please note
you must **add a feature** or **fix a bug**, along with adding your username
to our [userlist file](https://github.com/larvalabs/pullup/blob/master/config/userlist.js).
In general, we prefer the following for your first pull request:

* It includes a user facing feature or bug fix.
* It is not a refactor, re-org of the code, or change to how the project functions.
* It works :)

Save your big refactors and "how it should work" changes until after you're
a member. This seems to cut down on debate and keep the focus on moving
forward. Other than that, go for it!
